## ðŸš¨ STOP - READ THIS FIRST

Before doing ANYTHING, read the critical rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

**The two rules you MUST NEVER violate:**
1. **NO CODE COMMENTS** - No `//` comments, ever. Use self-documenting names.
2. **NO AI ATTRIBUTION** - No `ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude` or `Co-Authored-By: Claude` in commits.

This guide has moved to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

Please read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (Agent Guide) for the full assistant guidance, including project overview, workflows, testing, styling principles, and migration notes.
