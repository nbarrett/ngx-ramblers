<div style="font-size:12px">
  <p>Thanks again for offering to lead the walk on <strong [textContent]="walk.walkDate | displayDate"
                                                           class="nowrap"></strong>!</p>
  <p>Before I can publish your walk, I need more information from you as <strong
    [textContent]="validationMessages | asWalkValidationsList"></strong>
  <p *ngIf="event.reason" [textContent]="event.reason"></p>
  <p>For info, the details of your walk at the moment are as follows:
    <app-walk-notification-details [data]="data"></app-walk-notification-details>
  </p>
  <p>When you get a moment, please could you complete the above information either directly on the site or by emailing
    me.
    I'll then give it a quick check, mark it as approved, and then it will be published on our walks programme for all
    to see.</p>
  <app-walk-notification-footer [data]="data"></app-walk-notification-footer>
