<div style="font-size:12px">
  <p>This email is to notify you as an Expense Approver, that <strong
    [textContent]="display.expenseClaimLatestEvent(expenseClaim).memberId | memberIdToFullName : members"></strong>
    has just updated <strong
      [textContent]="(display.expenseClaimCreatedEvent(expenseClaim).memberId | memberIdToFullName : members) + '\'s'"
      class="nowrap"></strong>
    EKWG expense claim to a status of <strong
      [textContent]="display.expenseClaimLatestEvent(expenseClaim).eventType.description"></strong>.
    For reference, the claim was originally created on <span
      [textContent]="display.expenseClaimCreatedEvent(expenseClaim).date | displayDate" class="nowrap"></span>
    and contains the following <span [textContent]="expenseClaim.expenseItems.length"></span> item(s):
  </p>
  <app-expense-notification-details [expenseClaim]="expenseClaim"></app-expense-notification-details>
  <p>Because an EKWG expense claim needs 2 stages of approval, it will now need to be approved by a different person
    (e.g. not <span
      [textContent]="display.expenseClaimLatestEvent(expenseClaim).memberId | memberIdToFirstName : members"></span>).
    Then Jon will be automatically notified to organise the payment.</p>
