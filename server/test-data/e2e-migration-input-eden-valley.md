## Eden Valley Walk

![](images/route.jpg) 

This 16 mile walk from Cernes Farm, a few miles south west of Edenbridge, to Tonbridge Castle was opened on 23 March 1991 by Lord de L'Isle of Penshurst.

There is a full description of the route with 1:25,000 maps and information about points of interest in our guide to Three River Valley Walks in West Kent, available now from our [books page](../../Books/index.htm).
