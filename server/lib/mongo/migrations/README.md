# Database Migrations

This directory contains database migrations managed by [migrate-mongo](https://github.com/seppevs/migrate-mongo).

## Overview

Migrations run automatically when the server starts. They are:
- **TypeScript + ESM**: All migrations use TypeScript with ES modules for type safety and modern syntax
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Tracked**: Applied migrations are stored in the `changelog` collection
- **Locked**: Only one instance can run migrations at a time (TTL: 300s)
- **Environment-aware**: Uses `MONGODB_URI` from environment variables

## Automatic Execution

Migrations run automatically on server startup:
1. Server checks for pending migrations
2. Applies them in chronological order
3. Records each successful migration in the `changelog` collection
4. If any migration fails, the server will not start

## Manual Commands

```bash
# Check migration status
npm run migrate:status

# Run pending migrations (normally done automatically on startup)
npm run migrate

# Rollback last migration
npm run migrate:down

# Create a new migration
npm run migrate:create <migration-name>
```

**Note**: Manual commands require `MONGODB_URI` environment variable to be set.

## Creating New Migrations

1. Create a new migration file:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:create my-migration-name
   ```

2. Edit the generated file in `migrations/` using ESM syntax:
   ```typescript
   import { Db, MongoClient } from "mongodb";
   import createMigrationLogger from "./migration-logger";

   const debugLog = createMigrationLogger("my-migration-name");

   export async function up(db: Db, client: MongoClient) {
     debugLog("Starting migration...");
     const collection = db.collection("myCollection");
     await collection.updateMany({}, { $set: { newField: "value" } });
     debugLog("Migration completed");
   }

   export async function down(db: Db, client: MongoClient) {
     debugLog("Rolling back migration...");
     const collection = db.collection("myCollection");
     await collection.updateMany({}, { $unset: { newField: "" } });
     debugLog("Rollback completed");
   }
   ```

3. Commit the migration file - it will run automatically on next deployment

## Existing Migrations

### 20240101000000-migrate-media-urls.ts (Retrospective)
Migrates media URLs from old format (`api/aws/s3/...`) to new direct format.

**Purpose**: Remove API proxy prefix from media URLs in groupEvents.

**Note**: This migration was created retroactively from code in `DataMigrationService.migrateMedia()`. If this was already run manually in your environment, mark it as applied:
```bash
npm run migrate:mark-old-applied
```

### 20240101000001-update-osmaps-urls.ts (Retrospective)
Updates OS Maps URLs from old domain (`osmaps.ordnancesurvey.co.uk`) to new domain (`explore.osmaps.com`).

**Purpose**: Update external links to use the new OS Maps domain.

**Note**: This migration was created retroactively from code in `DataMigrationService.updateOsMapsRoute()`. If this was already run manually in your environment, mark it as applied:
```bash
npm run migrate:mark-old-applied
```

### 20251022220737-migrate-inline-content-text.ts
Migrates `contentTextId` references to inline `contentText` in all page content columns, including action buttons, nested rows, and all page content types.

**Purpose**: Eliminates the separate `contentText` collection dependency by inlining text directly into page content documents. Handles all page content types including ACTION_BUTTONS, text columns, and nested structures recursively.

**How it works**:

1. **Scans all page content documents** from the `pageContent` collection
2. **Recursively processes all rows and columns** (including nested rows)
3. For each column that has a `contentTextId` but no `contentText`:
   - Looks up the corresponding document in the `contentText` collection
   - Copies the `text` field to `contentText` on the column
   - **Deletes** the `contentTextId` field (removes it entirely, not set to null)
4. **Only updates documents that changed** using deep equality comparison (`isEqual`)
5. Logs each inlined contentTextId for debugging

**What gets migrated**:
- Regular text columns with `contentTextId`
- ACTION_BUTTONS columns (admin buttons, committee year buttons, etc.)
- Nested rows at any depth (columns can contain rows which contain columns, etc.)
- All page content types (TEXT, ACTION_BUTTONS, slides, carousels, etc.)

**Before** (column structure):
```json
{
  "title": "Migration Settings",
  "icon": "faExchangeAlt",
  "href": "admin/migration-settings",
  "contentTextId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"
}
```

**After** (column structure):
```json
{
  "title": "Migration Settings",
  "icon": "faExchangeAlt",
  "href": "admin/migration-settings",
  "contentText": "Configure settings for migrating content from legacy static websites."
}
```

**Safety features**:
- Skips columns that already have `contentText` (idempotent)
- Handles missing contentText documents gracefully (logs error, continues)
- Only updates documents with actual changes
- Uses `es-toolkit` `isEqual` for robust comparison (avoids property order issues)

### 20251022220623-cleanup-duplicate-page-content.ts
Removes duplicate page content entries and creates a unique index on the `path` field.

**Purpose**:
- Cleans up existing duplicates (keeps most recently updated)
- Prevents future duplicates via unique constraint

## Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Test migrations on local/staging before production
2. **Backup**: Always have a database backup before major migrations
3. **Idempotent**: Design migrations to be safely run multiple times
4. **Atomic**: Keep migrations focused on a single logical change
5. **Rollback**: Implement `down()` when possible (not all migrations are reversible)

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails on Startup
If a migration fails, the server will not start. Check logs for error details:
```
Migration failed: <error message>
Server will not start until migrations are successful
```

**Resolution**:
1. Fix the migration code
2. Or manually rollback: `npm run migrate:down`
3. Restart the server

### Check Health Status
The `/api/health` endpoint includes migration status:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "migrations": {
    "pending": 0,
    "applied": 2,
    "failed": false
  }
}
```

Status will be `DEGRADED` (HTTP 503) if migrations are pending or failed.

## Site Maintenance Page

When migrations are pending or have failed, the application automatically shows a maintenance page to users:

### For Regular Users
- Redirected to `/admin/site-maintenance` automatically on app load
- Shows current migration status (pending/failed)
- Displays a loading spinner and message
- Page auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- Automatically redirects to home when migrations complete

### For Admin Users
- Can access the site normally even when migrations are pending/failed
- Maintenance page shows additional admin controls:
  - **Retry Migrations** button to manually trigger migration retry
  - **View Logs** button to open health endpoint
  - Real-time status updates
  - Success/failure messages after retry attempts

### How It Works
1. **App Initialization**: On startup, Angular checks migration status via `/api/health`
2. **Status Check**: If migrations are pending/failed, app redirects to maintenance page
3. **Admin Bypass**: Admins (`memberHasAnyPrivilege()`) can bypass and access site normally
4. **Auto-Recovery**: Once migrations succeed, users are automatically redirected to home

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Get current migration status (public)
- `GET /api/database/migrations/status` - Detailed migration info (public)
- `POST /api/database/migrations/retry` - Retry pending migrations (requires auth)

### Component Location
- **Frontend**: `projects/ngx-ramblers/src/app/pages/admin/site-maintenance/site-maintenance.component.ts`
- **Service**: `projects/ngx-ramblers/src/app/services/site-maintenance.service.ts`
- **Initializer**: `projects/ngx-ramblers/src/app/services/site-maintenance-initializer.ts`
- **API**: `server/lib/mongo/routes/migrations.ts`

## Configuration

Configuration is in `migrations/migrate-mongo-config.ts`:
- **URL**: Uses `MONGODB_URI` environment variable
- **Migrations Dir**: `migrations/`
- **File Extension**: `.ts` (TypeScript)
- **Changelog Collection**: `changelog`
- **Lock Collection**: `changelog_lock` (TTL: 300s)

All npm migration scripts automatically use the config file in the migrations folder.
