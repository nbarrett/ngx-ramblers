### Committee
Add Committee Member; layer File Admin for document maintenance.

### Offboarding

---

## Security Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Only assign privileges that are necessary for the member's role
- Regularly review member privileges and remove unnecessary access
- When members leave committee roles, update their privileges accordingly

### Audit Trail
- All member login activity is recorded in the Member Login Audit
- Member Admin users can view this audit at `/admin/member-login-audit`
- Changes to member records are tracked with timestamps and user identification

### Multiple Administrators
- Assign Member Admin to at least 2 people to avoid single points of failure
- Ensure Walk Admin is assigned to multiple walk coordinators
- Consider having backup administrators for critical roles

### Regular Reviews
- Review member privileges quarterly or when committee roles change
- Remove "Approved Group Member" from lapsed or resigned members
- Update privileges immediately when committee elections occur

---

## Troubleshooting

### Member Cannot Log In
**Check:** Is "Approved Group Member" selected?
- If unchecked, the member will be denied login access
- This is the most common cause of login issues

### Member Cannot See Admin Menu
**Check:** Does the member have at least one admin privilege?
- Member Admin, Content Admin, Walk Admin, Social Admin, or File Admin

### Member Not Receiving Walk Notifications
**Check:** Is "Walk Change Notifications" selected?
- This must be explicitly enabled to receive walk change emails
- Walk Admin alone does not trigger notifications

### Member Cannot Approve Expenses
**Check:** Is "Finance Admin" selected?
- This privilege is required to approve expense claims
- Treasury Admin is for payment processing, not approval

### Member Cannot Access Committee Files
**Check:** Is "Committee Member" selected?
- Files marked as "Committee Only" require this privilege
- File Admin allows editing but requires Committee Member to view restricted files
